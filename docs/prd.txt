# Overview
This document outlines the project requirements for a first-person survival RPG game developed in Godot 4+. The game is intended for players who enjoy survival, base-building, and RPG elements. The core problem this game solves is providing a challenging and engaging survival experience with procedurally generated levels, ensuring high replayability. Its value lies in the combination of popular game mechanics within the open-source Godot engine, allowing for a feature-rich experience.

# Core Features
- **Base Building:** Players can construct bases for shelter, storage, and crafting. This is crucial for survival and progression. It will work by allowing the player to place pre-defined building blocks in the world.
- **Inventory System:** The player will have a grid-based inventory to manage resources, tools, and equipment. This is essential for crafting and survival. The system will support item stacking, moving, and dropping. [1, 4, 7, 10, 17]
- **Resource Gathering and Crafting:** Players can gather resources from the environment such as wood, stone, and ores. These resources are used to craft building components, tools, weapons, armor, and forging stations.
- **Intelligent Enemy AI:** The game will feature enemies with AI that can navigate the environment, detect the player, and employ attack patterns, providing a challenging combat experience. [6, 15, 16, 20]
- **Saving and Loading:** Players can save their progress and load it at a later time, a fundamental feature for any RPG. [11, 12, 24, 26, 35]
- **Procedural World Generation:** Each level's environment will be procedurally generated, offering a unique experience with every playthrough. [9, 19, 21, 25, 32]
- **Open-Source Assets:** All 3D models and sound effects will be sourced from open-source asset packs available online to keep development costs low.
- **Levels and Bosses:** The game will have multiple levels, each with a unique boss. Defeating a boss will yield powerful loot and unlock the next procedurally generated level.
- **First-Person Perspective:** The game will be played from a first-person point of view to enhance immersion. [2, 5, 8, 27, 31]
- **Particle Effects:** Visual effects will be used for actions like crafting, combat, and environmental effects to enrich the player experience. [3, 14, 22, 23, 30]
- **Dynamic Weather and Day-Night Cycle:** The game will feature changing weather patterns and a day-night cycle, affecting gameplay and visuals.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** The lighting system will realistically reflect the time of day and weather conditions.
- **Player Respawn:** Upon death, the player will respawn at their nearest constructed base.
- **Ambient and Action Sounds:** The game will include ambient sounds for the environment and sound effects for player actions, sourced from online resources. [13, 18, 36, 42]
- **Equipment Progression Tree:** A clear progression path for equipment will exist, allowing players to craft increasingly powerful gear.
- **Equipment Power Measurement:** Equipment will have a power rating. Players will need to meet a certain power threshold to effectively combat tougher enemies and bosses.
- **Skill Trees:** Players can invest skill points into active and passive skill trees to enhance their crafting, gathering, combat, and survival abilities.
- **Menus and Settings:** The game will have proper main menus, in-game menus, and settings for resolution and other options.
- **Realistic Movement and Physics:** Player, enemy, and boss movements will be smooth and physics-based for a more realistic and engaging experience. [28, 37, 38, 40, 43]

# User Experience
- **User Personas:** The target audience includes fans of survival games like "Rust" and "Ark: Survival Evolved," as well as players who enjoy RPGs with crafting and progression systems. They are typically looking for a challenging and long-term gameplay experience.
- **Key User Flows:**
    - **Initial Gameplay Loop:** The player starts in a new world, gathers basic resources, crafts initial tools, and builds a small starting base before the first night.
    - **Progression Loop:** The player explores the world, gathers more advanced resources, crafts better equipment and stations, expands their base, and fights progressively harder enemies.
    - **Boss Fight Loop:** The player prepares for a boss fight by crafting the best possible gear and stocking up on consumables. After defeating the boss, they acquire powerful drops and advance to a new, more challenging level.
- **UI/UX Considerations:**
    - The UI will be clean and intuitive, with clear indicators for health, hunger, thirst, and other vital stats.
    - The inventory and crafting menus will be easy to navigate using a grid-based system.
    - Building placement will be user-friendly, with a snapping system to aid construction. [33]
    - Skill trees will be visually represented to clearly show progression paths.

    - **Player Controller:** A CharacterBody3D node with a first-person camera script. [2, 5, 8, 27, 31]
    - **Inventory System:** A custom resource-based system to manage item data. [1, 4, 7, 10, 17]
    - **Crafting System:** A dictionary-based system to define and handle crafting recipes.
    - **Building System:** A grid-based placement system for constructing bases. [33]
    - **Procedural Generation:** Using FastNoiseLite for generating terrain and resource distribution. [9, 19, 21, 25, 32]
    - **Enemy AI:** NavigationAgent3D for pathfinding and state machines for behavior. [6, 15, 16, 20, 29]
    - **Save/Load System:** Utilizing Godot's built-in JSON or custom resource saving capabilities. [11, 12, 24, 26, 35]
    - **Game Manager:** A global script (autoload) to manage game state, player stats, and level progression.
- **Data Models:**
    - **ItemData:** A custom Resource defining properties of each item (name, description, stack size, etc.).
    - **PlayerData:** A custom Resource to store player stats, inventory, and skill progression for saving and loading.
    - **WorldData:** A data structure to save the state of the procedurally generated world, including player-built structures.
- **APIs and Integrations:** The project will rely on Godot's built-in APIs. External libraries will not be a primary focus to maintain simplicity.

# Risks and Mitigations
- **Technical Challenges:**
    - **Procedural Generation Performance:** Large, detailed procedural worlds can be performance-intensive.
        - **Mitigation:** Implement chunk-based loading and Level of Detail (LOD) systems to manage performance. Use efficient noise algorithms. [9]
    - **Complex AI:** Creating truly "intelligent" AI is a significant challenge.
        - **Mitigation:** Start with simple state-based AI and incrementally add complexity. Focus on creating believable and challenging behaviors rather than human-like intelligence. [6, 20]
- **Figuring out the MVP:**
    - **Scope Creep:** The extensive list of requirements can lead to an overly ambitious MVP that is never completed.
        - **Mitigation:** Strictly adhere to the defined MVP requirements. The goal of the MVP is to have a playable, core gameplay loop, not a feature-complete game.
- **Resource Constraints:**
    - **Asset Creation:** While using open-source assets is planned, finding a consistent art style and all necessary assets can be time-consuming.
        - **Mitigation:** Allocate specific time for asset sourcing and curation. Prioritize core gameplay assets first.
    - **Development Time:** A single developer or small team will face a significant time commitment.
        - **Mitigation:** Follow the phased development roadmap to ensure steady progress and maintain motivation. Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.
